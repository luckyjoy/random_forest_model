**Random Forest Model for Predicting Customer Satisfaction**

Random Forests are powerful statistical learning algorithms known for their ability to reduce variance, bias, and minimize the risk of overfitting.

In this activity, you will train, tune, and evaluate a Random Forest model using a dataset of survey responses from 129,880 customers. The dataset includes features such as class, flight distance, and inflight entertainment, and the goal is to predict whether a customer will be satisfied with their flight experience.

**Note:** As this lab uses a real-world dataset, the first step will involve performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning the data, and applying necessary transformations to prepare it for effective modeling.
